Package Installation
-------------------
The best way to install Nette Calendar is using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
$ composer require galek/doctrine-fb-driver
```

In configuration of doctrine use:
```
driverClass: '\Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Ibase\Firebird\Driver'
```
do not use driver ;)
